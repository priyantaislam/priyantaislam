### Hello there 👋 

- 🏙️ I am a software engineer based in Sydney, Australia. My interests include retro gaming, vintage computers and low level programming. I also love learning about the underlying mathematical concepts in computer science. 
- 🕹️ I make pixel art and it is one of my favourite visual media, I love how expressive it can get even though it is very restrictive in nature.
- 🎸 I play guitar and bass, and some piano. I enjoy playing over-the-top, outrageous guitar solos.
